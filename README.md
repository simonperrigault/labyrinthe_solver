Implements a pathfinder thanks to 3 differents algorithms : Djikstra, A* and Jump Point Search.
You can use the graphical interface to create and update your own map, which is saved in a file.
Choose the algorithm you want to use, a start and an end, and see the animation.
The animation represents the open (green) and close (blue) queue of the different algorithms.
If the end is reachable, one of the optimal paths is displayed.
You can then try again with a different map, start, end or algorithm.
Hope you enjoy it !
